# Thesis proposal

A thesis proposal or a research plan should be a short (maximally 3 pages) description describing the project, its significance for our research area, what questions it will answer, how the research will be done and the expected outcomes of the project.

## Title

A descriptive (working) title of the project

## Author

Your name and your email

## Supervisor(s)

Who are you working with

## Examiner

Who will exmaine the thesis. You will get this information in your Masters Project class.

## Goal

Describe the problem that you will address and your solution in one paragraph.

## Background

Describe the problem in more detail, for example by giving some examples, and discuss some  solutions have been offered to solve it in the literature. Clearly state your research questions as bullte points. Outline their findings and state what open questions thye leave us to explore. Use properly formatted citations and include them under the heading references below.

## Problem description

What open questions that you identified in the previous section will you address? These will be your research questions that you will asnwer.

Note that for this reason research questions need not necessarily be formatted as questions but as a list of accomplished goals, for example "Investigate the effect of a dataset bias on the effects of fine-tuning...". This corresponds to "What is the effect of a dataset bias on the effect of fine-tuning for...?"

## Required knowledge and skills

List (as bullet points) required skills that you will need. It is also helpful if you state what courses the thesis is most related to and will beuild upon.

## Tools and resources

What tools will you need? These include: (i) equippment, (ii) datasets, (iii) frameworks, (iv) human subjects, etc.

## Work plan

Write down the steps that are required to complete this project (inclusing writing the thesis text) in a bullet form. The plan should correspond to the steps required to answer each of your research questions stated at the end of the projetc description section. Once you have listed all the steps think about how much time you would need to accomplish each step. Here it is best to think in weeks. If it turns out the plan is too ambitious, re-think the research questions and redefine the projetc plan.

## Ethical considerations

What ethical considerations one might consider when doing this project. Wll you be working with people: what data will be collected from them and how this data will be used in research and results about it will be communicated? Are there any ethical considerations related to the data you will be using?

## Dangers and limitations

Are there any obstacles you might encounter or dangers you expect to arise while you work on this project? If so, what back-up steps do you plan so that you could still complete the project, perhaps with redefined research questions and goal.

What are the limitations of the proposed plan? What questions that are relevant you might not be able to answer in this study and will be left for other studies.

## Any other relevant information

...not included in the headers above. For example: (i) you are working with an external supervisor in a company - outline how your work will be organiseed and also how supervision will be arranged. Or you are studying part time and hence you will work on the project X%.

## References

Properly formatted reference, preferably following the ACL formatting style. The easiset way to achive this is to use [the ACL style files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).

Before hending in the thesis plan, don't forget to send it and discuss it with your supervisors (i.e. us) first.
