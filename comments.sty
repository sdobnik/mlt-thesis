% Define author names at the beginning of the document:
%  \newauthor[cmdname]{displayname}{colour}
% where displayname is the (short) name that will be placed 
% at the start of comments, and cmdname is the name that 
% will be used in the command to add comments. If cmdname is 
% not given, displayname is used; but note that it must be 
% usable as part of a Latex command (i.e. no spaces, etc).
% Give also a colour that will be used to distinguish this 
% author's comments.
%
% Then add comments with the command:
% \cmt<cmdname>{Comment text here}
% For example, if I define myself as the author:
% \newauthor{MGW}{red}
% then I can add comments using:
% \cmtMGW{This is my comment}
%
% You can also pass through options to the \todo command 
% for a comment, such as the inline option:
% \cmtMGW[inline]{My inline comment}
